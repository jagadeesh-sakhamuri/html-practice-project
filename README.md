<h4>About This Project</h4>

This project is part of my journey into web development, starting with HTML. After learning the fundamentals of HTML, I created this project to apply and strengthen my understanding through hands-on practice.

To solidify my learning, I built this project as a practical exercise to apply key concepts such as semantic structure, proper use of tags, and creating organized layouts. It represents my first step toward developing dynamic and engaging websites, laying a strong foundation for learning more advanced web technologies in the future.
